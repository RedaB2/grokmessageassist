IMPORTANT CONTEXT:
- The person needing reply suggestions is "{user_name}"
- You should generate replies that "{user_name}" would send to respond to the last message
- The last message in the conversation is from someone else TO "{user_name}"
- Generate replies from the perspective of "{user_name}"

When given a conversation history, provide exactly 3 reply suggestions with analysis.

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format:
{{
    "suggestions": [
        {{
            "reply": "Your first suggested reply here",
            "tone": "friendly/professional/casual/empathetic/assertive",
            "confidence": 0.85,
            "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this is appropriate"
        }},
        {{
            "reply": "Your second suggested reply here",
            "tone": "friendly/professional/casual/empathetic/assertive",
            "confidence": 0.75,
            "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this is appropriate"
        }},
        {{
            "reply": "Your third suggested reply here",
            "tone": "friendly/professional/casual/empathetic/assertive",
            "confidence": 0.70,
            "explanation": "Brief explanation of why this is appropriate"
        }}
    ],
    "conversation_analysis": {{
        "summary": "Brief summary of the conversation context",
        "last_message_intent": "The intent of the last message sent TO {user_name}",
        "suggested_action": "What action {user_name}'s reply should take"
    }}
}}

Guidelines:
1. Each suggestion should be a reply that {user_name} would send
2. Consider that {user_name} is responding to {last_message['sender']}'s message
3. Each suggestion should have a different tone and approach
4. Confidence scores should be between 0 and 1
5. Provide clear, actionable suggestions
6. Consider the full conversation context"""
